# Outbound Properties

> A Client Vue.js project for a new development in NE Portland Oregon

This site is still under development.  
I am waiting on content to fill in the dummy text that I have provided.  
I designed the logo and the layout of the site and am participating in the marketing copy.  
Permits are being pulled, and it's looking like the team will be moving dirt early Summer 2020
